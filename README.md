# us_pop_diabetes
Dataset provided by www.cdc.gov. I use Python and libraries like pandas and matplotlib to perform basic data analytics on a dataset on diabetes in the U.S. population. I also provide prediction results on how diabetes will affect the population in the upcoming years based on the current trend.
